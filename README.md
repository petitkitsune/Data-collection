Web scraping is one of the most important skills for data scientists. It's not glamorous, but it is essential. What can't a data scientist do without? Data!

Web scraping sounds great, but the problem is that it's expensive. If your company uses an API subscription and can't scrape data from a website without paying for it, web scraping isn't for you. That's why we use bots that scrape data from websites to store in a CSV, JSON file or a database-without any additional cost to your business.

Websites like data.world and old.reddit.com provide public datasets that you can scrape from using our powered scraping bot. This is a perfect solution for data scientists who want to create data science projects with their own personalized insights and analysis, then present them on the web as evidence of their skills and knowledge.
